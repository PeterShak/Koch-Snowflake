### Step-by-Step Description
At each recursive step, the following happens:
  1. Split each line segment into 3 equal parts.
  2. Replace the middle segment with two segments forming an equilateral triangle.

### Base case:
  1. At this point, no more modifications are made to the segments. The base case could be a simple drawing of the original triangle without any further division.

### Translation:
  1. I would translate the shape to the middle of the canvas.
